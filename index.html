            <p id="paragraph1">Do you remember<br>
               The twenty-first night of September?<br>
                Love was changin' the minds of pretenders<br>
                While chasin' the clouds away<br>
                Our hearts were ringin'<br>
                In the key that our souls were singin'<br>
                As we danced in the night, remember<br>
                How the stars stole the night away, oh yeah<br></p>
                
                
            <p id="paragraph2">Hey, hey, hey<br>
                Ba-dee-ya<br>
                Say, do you remember?<br>
                Ba-dee-ya<br>
                Dancin' in September<br>
                Ba-dee-ya<br>
                Never was a cloudy day<br></p>
                
            <p id="paragraph3">Ba-du, ba-du, ba-du, ba-du<br>
                Ba-du, ba-du, ba-du, ba-du<br>
                Ba-du, ba-du, ba-du-da<br>
                Ba-du, yeah<br></p>
                
            <p id="paragraph4">My thoughts are with you<br>
                Holdin' hands with your heart to see you<br>
                Only blue talk and love, remember<br>
                How we knew love was here to stay<br>
                Now December<br>
                Found a love we shared in September<br>
                Only blue talk and love, remember<br>
                True love we share today<br></p>
